Stress-Strain Calculation under Exponential External Pressure with Rotation

Overview

This Mathematica notebook implements a computational model to evaluate stresses and strains in a cylindrical geometry subjected to exponential external pressure, including the effects of rotation. The model is designed for structural or geomechanical analysis of reinforcement under pressure loading.

Features

Solves for stress components in cylindrical coordinates.
Models pressure distribution as an exponential function.
Includes rotational equilibrium in the formulation.
Computes reinforcement force and position.
Uses symbolic and numerical computation in Wolfram Mathematica.

Requirements

Wolfram Mathematica (Recommended version: 12.0 or later)

How to Use

Open the notebook in Mathematica.
Set parameters:
Radii, external pressure parameters, material properties
Evaluate each section using Shift + Enter.
Inspect outputs:
Stress distribution plots
Output

Numerical and symbolic results for:
Stress fields (radial and tangential)
